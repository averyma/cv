    \textbf{M.A.Sc. in Systems Design Engineering}
    \hfill
    \textbf{Waterloo ON}\\
    \textit{University of Waterloo, Vision and Image Processing Lab}
    \hfill
    \textit{May 2016 -- Apr 2018 (expected)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Supervised by Professor Alexander Wong and Professor David Clausi
        \item Thesis: "Depth from Defocus via Active Quasi-random Pattern Projections"
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Designed a novel active depth sensing system that infers depth by analyzing the blurriness of the projection pattern at different depth levels caused by camera defocus
            \item Built an ensemble of deep neural networks as the inference model to reconstruct 3D images
        \end{itemize}
        \item Cumulative GPA : 91 \% (4.0 / 4.0 equivalent) 
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{B.A.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering, Honours, Co-operative Program}
    \hfill
    \textbf{Waterloo ON}\\
    \textit{University of Waterloo}
    \hfill
    \textit{Sept 2011 -- Apr 2016}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Capstone project: \href{https://youtu.be/OwfrKlr_Zhk}{"All Terrain Personal Transportation Device"}
        \begin{itemize}
           \item Engineered a personal transportation platform that is capable of carrying a 70kg person for 10km at walking speed on a single charge
           \item Implemented the maneuver control system using PID control theory that enabled users to ride the device by simply changing the center of gravity
        \end{itemize}
        \item Cumulative GPA : 83 \% (3.7 / 4.0 equivalent)
    \end{itemize}
